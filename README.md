## project-starters

A set of different starting points for new web projects, using different combinations of libraries and technologies. The idea is partly to have something I can just copy to my dev folder and start working on, but it's also a way to learn new techniques and tools as I get interested in them.

The current starters listed below are roughly in order of complexity.

#### basic-html5-page

A single page with a basic navigation bar and hero unit, empty `css\main.css` and `js\main.js` files, and local copies of the jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap libraries.

- [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)
